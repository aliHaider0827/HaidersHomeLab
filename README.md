# HaidersHomeLab
Hopefully a fully-documented, home lab specifically built for networking, routing, security, and system design practice.

## 1. Purpose

I cannot get a job... I cannot get any real experience. 
This home lab exists for two goals:
    1. Assist in helping me get a job.
    2. To simulate a real multi-VLAN, mutli device network environment where I can practice.

It is a learning platform.

## 2. Hardware

## **Core Devices**
- 1x Mini-Pc (Running pfSense | Router and Firewall).
- 2x Juniper EX4200 switches.
- 6U open rack.
- Power distribution strip.
- Home workstation (VMs).

## **Future Hardware**
-  2 Raspberry Pis ( 1 for monitoring | 1 for a future project :) )
-  Additional stroage/server VM host.

  
Below is a demo of the rack made virtually:
